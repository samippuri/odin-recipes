    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally,
             until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all 
             but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
        <li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent,
             about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan,
             and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes
              are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, 
            stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.
             Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
